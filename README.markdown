Street View for TAS
---------------

This is Processing based street-view system for school.

  - Supports five locations
  - A colored floor plan  of the first floor serves as a satellite 'map', similar to Google's Street View
 
The program has not been interfaced with the colored floor plan at the moment. The default image is of the lower field. Change the `b = loadImage();` line for now to change locations.
